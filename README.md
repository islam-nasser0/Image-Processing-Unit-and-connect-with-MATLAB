Description: making operations on photos like brightness and contrast using hardware of the image processing unit

## block diagran of image processing unit

### design phase 
you can find the RTL in the repo the most important part is the multiplier as i will use it to make image more brightness 

## simulation to verify multiplication operation

## MATLAB Scripts 

i write matlab code to convert image to 256*256 matrix and write it in text file 

and another script to take values from image processing unit and show it again

## verilog Script 

i Write script with Verilog to take inputs from text file and multiply with 2 then save the output to text file 

## back to matlab again 

-Go to MATLAB and view the output of image processing to have more brightness photo

## synthesis the design
